-**What is Nodejs?**
================
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and efficient network applications. Here are some key points about Node.js:


Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chromeâ€™s core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

Maintened by: Openjs Foundation.


### History:

- **Creation**: Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

- **Initial Release**: The first version of Node.js was released in 2009.

- **Growth**: Node.js has gained significant popularity due to its performance, scalability, and the ability to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development.

- **Acquisition by Joyent**: Initially developed at Joyent, a company that specializes in cloud computing.


### Key Features:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.

2. **Single-Threaded**: Node.js runs on a single thread, which simplifies the development process and reduces the complexity of managing multiple threads. However, it can handle multiple requests concurrently using asynchronous programming.

3. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js comes with a vast ecosystem of packages and modules available through the npm registry, which simplifies the process of adding functionality to applications.

4. **Cross-Platform**: Node.js can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux

5. **Asynchronour ios or non-blocking io**: Node.js uses asynchronous I/O operations, which means that it can handle multiple requests without blocking the main thread. This makes it highly efficient for I/O-bound applications.

6. **JavaScript Everywhere**: Since Node.js uses JavaScript, developers can use the same language for both client-side and server-side development, which simplifies the learning curve and improves productivity.



### Use Cases:
- **Web Servers**: Node.js is well-suited for building web servers, especially those that requir
e high performance and scalability.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Node.js is ideal for real-time applications, such as live updates,
chatbots, and gaming platforms.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Node.js can be used to build microservices, which are small,
independent services that communicate with each other.

- **APIs**: Node.js is often used to build RESTful APIs, which are used to communicate between different software systems.

- **Command-Line Tools**: Node.js can be used to build command-line tools and utilities.




* **What is V8 Engine?**

The V8 engine is a JavaScript engine developed by Google for Google Chrome. It is also used in Node.js to execute JavaScript code. Wrtten in C++. The V8 engine compiles JavaScript code into machine code, which can be executed directly by the computer's CPU. This makes JavaScript code run faster and more efficiently. The V8 engine is open-source and is used in many other projects, such as Couchbase and MongoDB.

V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.

Here are some key features of the V8 engine:
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: The V8 engine compiles JavaScript code into
machine code on the fly, which makes it run faster.
- **Garbage Collection**: The V8 engine has a garbage collector that automatically
manages memory and frees up resources when they are no longer needed.
- **Dynamic Typing**: The V8 engine supports dynamic typing, which means that
variable types are determined at runtime rather than at compile time.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The V8 engine supports object-oriented programming
(OOP) concepts, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.


# **Browser JavaScript vs Node.js**

JavaScript can run in two environments: **browsers** and **Node.js**. While both use JavaScript as their core language, their execution environments, capabilities, and use cases differ significantly.

Browser JavaScript is executed in a sandboxed environment, which means that it is isolated from the rest of
the system and cannot access system resources directly. Node.js, on the other hand, runs in a
non-sandboxed environment, which means that it has access to system resources and can interact with the file system, network, and other system resources.

## **Key Differences**

- **Execution Environment**:
  - Browser JavaScript runs inside a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
  - Node.js runs in a server-side environment (Node.js runtime).

- **Access to System Resources**:
  - Browser JavaScript has limited access due to sandboxing.
  - Node.js has full access to system resources (file system, network, OS).

- **File System Access**:
  - Browser JavaScript has no direct access to local files.
  - Node.js can read, write, and modify local files.

- **Networking**:
  - Browser JavaScript uses `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` for HTTP requests.
  - Node.js supports `http`, `https`, `fs`, `net`, and more for networking tasks.

- **Concurrency**:
  - Browser JavaScript is event-driven, with concurrency limited to browser APIs.
  - Node.js uses an event loop and async I/O for high concurrency, handling many requests simultaneously.

- **Performance**:
  - Browser JavaScript is optimized for UI rendering and lightweight tasks.
  - Node.js is optimized for backend operations, handling multiple requests, and server-side computation.

- **Security**:
  - Browser JavaScript runs in a restricted sandbox environment for security.
  - Node.js has access to system-level resources and requires additional security measures.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Browser JavaScript handles errors through `try/catch`, `onerror`, and debugging tools.
  - Node.js supports extensive logging, error handling, and debugging mechanisms.

- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Browser JavaScript uses Promises, `async/await`, `setTimeout`, etc., for asynchronous programming.
  - Node.js supports Promises, `async/await`, and event-driven programming to handle I/O operations.

- **Modules**:
  - Browser JavaScript uses ES6 modules (`import/export`).
  - Node.js uses CommonJS (`require/module.exports`) but also supports ES6 modules.

- **Testing & Debugging**:
  - Browser JavaScript uses browser DevTools for testing and debugging.
  - Node.js provides debugging tools like `node --inspect`, and testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, etc.

- **Memory Management**:
  - Browser JavaScriptâ€™s memory is managed by the browser's garbage collector.
  - Node.jsâ€™s memory is managed by its internal garbage collector.




**What is ECMA Script?**
ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language specification. It is a general-purpose programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of ECMAScript. ECMAScript defines the syntax, types, objects, properties, functions, and program execution semantics of its conforming implementations.

# Understanding `this` and `globalThis` in Node.js

### `this === global`:
In Node.js, `this` refers to the current context, but in a regular module, `this` does not point to the global object (`global`). Instead, it refers to an empty object (`{}`). So, `this === global` is `false`.

### `this === module`:
In the context of a module, `this` refers to the module itself, which is different from `global`. Hence, `this === module` is `false`.

### `this === exports`:
In a module, `this` is actually equivalent to the `exports` object, which is used to export functionalities from the module. Therefore, `this === exports` is `true`.

### `globalThis === global`:
`globalThis` is a special global object that refers to the global scope in both browsers and Node.js. In Node.js, `globalThis` is equal to `global`, so `globalThis === global` is `true`.

### `this` and `globalThis` outputs:
- `this` in a Node.js module refers to an empty object (`{}`) since it doesn't point to the global object.
- `globalThis`, on the other hand, refers to the global context and outputs the same empty object (`{}`) as `this` in the module context.
