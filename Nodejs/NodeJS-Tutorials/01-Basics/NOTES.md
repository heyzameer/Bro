What is Nodejs?
================
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and efficient network applications. Here are some key points about Node.js:


Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chromeâ€™s core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

Maintened by: Node.js Foundation and . Openjs Foundation.


### History:

- **Creation**: Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

- **Initial Release**: The first version of Node.js was released in 2009.

- **Growth**: Node.js has gained significant popularity due to its performance, scalability, and the ability to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development.



### Key Features:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.

2. **Single-Threaded**: Node.js runs on a single thread, which simplifies the development process and reduces the complexity of managing multiple threads. However, it can handle multiple requests concurrently using asynchronous programming.

3. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js comes with a vast ecosystem of packages and modules available through the npm registry, which simplifies the process of adding functionality to applications.

4. **Cross-Platform**: Node.js can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux

5. **Asynchronour ios or non-blocking io**: Node.js uses asynchronous I/O operations, which means that it can handle multiple requests without blocking the main thread. This makes it highly efficient for I/O-bound applications.


6. **JavaScript Everywhere**: Since Node.js uses JavaScript, developers can use the same language for both client-side and server-side development, which simplifies the learning curve and improves productivity.
