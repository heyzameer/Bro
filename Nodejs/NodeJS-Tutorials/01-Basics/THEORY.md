# Node.js: Interview Preparation Guide

This document provides a detailed explanation of core Node.js concepts, structured in an interview-friendly format with practical examples and key takeaways.

---

## **1. What is Node.js?**

**Definition:**

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code *outside* of a web browser.  It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.  Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.  It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.

**Key Points for Interviews (Concise and Impactful):**

*   **Runtime Environment:**  Emphasize that it's *not* a framework or a library, but a runtime environment.
*   **Server-Side:**  Clearly state its primary use is for server-side development.
*   **Non-Blocking I/O:**  This is a *critical* differentiator. Explain that it allows handling multiple requests concurrently without waiting for each I/O operation to complete.  This leads to better performance under load.
*   **Single-Threaded Event Loop:** Mention this, but be prepared to explain it further (see section 4).
*   **Use Cases:** Give *specific* examples: real-time applications (chat, gaming), APIs, streaming services, and single-page applications (SPAs).  Avoid vague terms like "web applications."
*   **(Bonus - For Senior Roles):**  Mention that Node.js is particularly well-suited for microservices architectures.

---

## **2. Why V8 Engine?**

**Definition:**

The V8 engine is Google's open-source, high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. It's written in C++. It compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, using techniques like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

**Key Points for Interviews:**

*   **Performance:** Focus on *why* it's fast.  Mention JIT compilation and optimization techniques.  "It compiles JavaScript directly to machine code" is a strong, concise statement.
*   **Garbage Collection:**  Acknowledge that efficient memory management is a key part of performance.
*   **Chrome and Node.js:**  Reinforce the connection: "Originally developed for Chrome, it's also the heart of Node.js."  This shows you understand the context.
*   **(Bonus - For Senior Roles):**  If you're familiar with specific V8 optimization techniques (like hidden classes or inline caching), briefly mention them, but only if you can explain them clearly.

---

## **3. Advantages & Disadvantages of Node.js**

### **Advantages:**

*   ✅ **Performance:**  "High performance due to the V8 engine and non-blocking I/O."  Connect the advantages back to the core concepts.
*   ✅ **Scalability:** "Easily scalable, especially horizontally, using techniques like clustering and load balancing." This shows you understand real-world deployment concerns.
*   ✅ **Full-Stack JavaScript:**  "Allows using JavaScript for both frontend and backend, reducing context switching and enabling code reuse."  This highlights developer productivity.
*   ✅ **Large Ecosystem (NPM):** "Vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools available through NPM (Node Package Manager)."  Be prepared to name some popular packages (e.g., Express, Mongoose, Socket.IO).
*   ✅**Active Community** Node.js has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources available
*   ✅**Easy to Learn** The learning curve is not that steep.

### **Disadvantages:**

*   ❌ **Single-Threaded Nature:** "While highly performant for I/O-bound tasks, Node.js's single-threaded nature can be a bottleneck for CPU-intensive operations."  Be ready to explain how to mitigate this (e.g., worker threads, child processes).
*   ❌ **Callback Hell (Mitigated):** "Historically, nested callbacks could lead to complex and hard-to-read code.  However, this is largely mitigated by using Promises and async/await."  Show you're aware of modern JavaScript solutions.
*   ❌ **Immature Modules (Less of an Issue Now):** "While the NPM ecosystem is vast, the quality and maintenance of packages can vary."  This shows you're aware of potential risks but also demonstrates critical thinking.

## **4. How Node.js Works (Event Loop and Non-Blocking I/O)?**

**Core Concept:** Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture with non-blocking I/O.

**Explanation (Step-by-Step, Interview-Ready):**

1.  **Request Arrival:** "When a client request arrives (e.g., an HTTP request), Node.js places it in the event queue."
2.  **Event Loop:** "The heart of Node.js is the event loop, which is a single thread that continuously monitors the event queue."
3.  **Non-Blocking I/O (libuv):** "If the request requires an I/O operation (like reading a file or making a network call), Node.js doesn't wait for it to complete. Instead, it uses the `libuv` library to perform the I/O operation *asynchronously* in the background."
4.  **Callback Registration:** "When the I/O operation is *started*, Node.js registers a callback function to be executed when the operation *completes*."
5.  **Event Loop Continues:** "The event loop *doesn't wait*. It immediately picks up the next request from the event queue and processes it. This is what makes Node.js non-blocking."
6.  **I/O Completion:** "Once the asynchronous I/O operation finishes, `libuv` notifies the event loop."
7.  **Callback Execution:** "The event loop, at the next opportunity, executes the callback function associated with the completed I/O operation.  This callback typically handles sending the response back to the client."

**Key Interview Takeaways:**

*   **Single Thread:**  Emphasize that the *event loop* is single-threaded, but I/O operations are handled asynchronously by `libuv`.
*   **Non-Blocking:**  Repeatedly stress that Node.js doesn't wait for I/O. This is the *key* to its performance and scalability.
*   **Event Queue and Callbacks:**  These are fundamental to the event-driven architecture.
*   **libuv:**  Know that `libuv` is the C library that provides the asynchronous I/O capabilities.
* **Diagram (if you can draw):** A simple diagram showing the event queue, event loop, and libuv interacting can be very helpful.

---

## **5. What is libuv?**

**Definition:**

libuv is a cross-platform support library that was originally written for Node.js. It is designed to abstract non-blocking I/O operations in a consistent way across all supported platforms.

**Key Points for Interviews:**

*   **Asynchronous I/O:** "libuv is the core component that enables Node.js's non-blocking I/O capabilities."
*   **Cross-Platform:** "It provides a consistent API for asynchronous operations across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)."
*   **Not Just Node.js:** While developed for Node.js, libuv is used by other projects as well.
*   **Handles More Than Just Network I/O:**
    *   File system operations
    *   DNS resolution
    *   Child processes
    *   Timers
    *   Signals
    *   Thread pool (for CPU-bound tasks that can be offloaded)
*   **(Bonus - For Senior Roles):**  If you've worked with libuv directly (e.g., in C/C++ addons), mention it briefly.

---

## **6. Node.js Module System**

**Definition:**

Node.js uses a modular architecture.  Modules are reusable blocks of code that encapsulate related functionality.  This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

**Types of Modules:**

1.  **Core Modules:** Built-in modules that come with Node.js.  Examples:
    *   `fs` (File System)
    *   `http` / `https` (Creating HTTP servers and clients)
    *   `path` (Working with file paths)
    *   `os` (Operating system utilities)
    *   `events` (Event emitter)
    *   `util` (Utility functions)

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs'); // No ./ needed for core modules
    ```

2.  **Local Modules:** Modules that you create within your own application.

    ```javascript
    // math.js
    exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
    exports.subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

    // app.js
    const math = require('./math'); // Relative path required
    console.log(math.add(5, 3));
    ```
    There are other ways to write module
    ```javascript
    // math.js
    function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    module.exports = add;

    //app.js
    const add = require('./math');
    console.log(add(5, 10)); // Output: 15
    ```

3.  **Third-Party Modules:** Modules installed from the NPM registry (or other sources).

    ```javascript
    // Install a package (e.g., Express)
    npm install express

    // app.js
    const express = require('express'); // No ./ needed
    const app = express();
    ```

**Key Interview Takeaways:**

*   **`require()`:**  The function used to import modules.
*   **`module.exports` / `exports`:**  Used to expose functionality from a module.
*   **Benefits of Modules:**  Organization, reusability, maintainability, and encapsulation.

---

## **7. Concurrency vs. Parallelism**

**Concurrency:**

*   **Definition:**  Dealing with *multiple tasks at the same time*, but not necessarily executing them simultaneously.  It's about the *structure* of the application.
*   **Node.js:** Node.js achieves concurrency through its single-threaded event loop and asynchronous I/O.  It can handle many operations *concurrently* without blocking.
*   **Analogy:** A single chef juggling multiple orders in a kitchen. They work on one order at a time, but switch between them efficiently, giving the *illusion* of doing multiple things at once.

**Parallelism:**

*   **Definition:**  Actually *executing multiple tasks simultaneously*, typically using multiple CPU cores.
*   **Node.js:**  Node.js itself is single-threaded (for the event loop).  To achieve true parallelism, you need to use:
    *   **Worker Threads:** (Node.js 10.5+)  Allow you to run JavaScript in parallel on separate threads.
    *   **Child Processes:**  Spawn separate Node.js processes.
    *   **Clustering:**  Create multiple instances of your application, each running in its own process.
*   **Analogy:** Multiple chefs working in a kitchen, each with their own set of ingredients and equipment, preparing different dishes simultaneously.

**Key Interview Takeaways:**

*   **Node.js is inherently concurrent, but not inherently parallel (out of the box).**
*   **Explain the difference clearly:** Concurrency is about *managing* multiple tasks; parallelism is about *executing* them simultaneously.
*   **Know how to achieve parallelism in Node.js:** Worker threads, child processes, and clustering are the key techniques.

---

## **8. REPL & CLI**

### **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):**

*   **Definition:** An interactive command-line environment for Node.js.  It allows you to type JavaScript code and immediately see the results.
*   **How to Start:**  Type `node` in your terminal.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Experimenting with JavaScript code.
    *   Testing small snippets of code.
    *   Debugging.
    *   Quick calculations.

    ```
    $ node
    > 1 + 1
    2
    > const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
    undefined
    > greet('World')
    'Hello, World!'
    > .exit // To exit the REPL
    ```

### **CLI (Command Line Interface):**

*   **Definition:** The way you interact with Node.js from your terminal to execute scripts and manage your applications.
*   **Running a Script:** `node your_script.js`
*   **Common CLI Commands:**
    *   `npm install <package>` (Install a package)
    *   `npm start` (Run the start script defined in `package.json`)
    *   `npm test` (Run tests)
    *   `npx <command>` (Execute a package without installing it globally)

---

## **9. What is NPX?**

**Definition:**

NPX (Node Package eXecute) is a tool that comes bundled with NPM (starting from version 5.2.0). It's designed to make it easier to run command-line tools and other executables that are available as NPM packages.

**Key Advantages:**

*   **Run Without Global Installation:**  You can run a package's binaries *without* installing it globally.  This avoids global package clutter and potential version conflicts.
*   **Temporary Installation:**  NPX can download and run the *latest* version of a package in a temporary environment, ensuring you're always using the most up-to-date version.
*   **Execute One-Off Commands:**  Ideal for tools you use infrequently or only once (e.g., `create-react-app`).

**Example:**

```bash
# Instead of:
# npm install -g create-react-app
# create-react-app my-app

# Use NPX:
npx create-react-app my-app
```

**How it Works:**

1.  **Checks Local:**  NPX first checks if the command is available in your project's local `node_modules/.bin` directory.
2.  **Downloads (if needed):** If not found locally, NPX downloads the package (and its dependencies) to a temporary location.
3.  **Executes:**  NPX runs the command.

# Node.js Interview Concepts: Modules, NPM, Event Loop, and Events

This document expands on key Node.js concepts, focusing on modules, NPM, the event loop, and events, providing a comprehensive guide for interview preparation.

---

## 11. Modules in Node.js

**Core Concept:** Node.js follows a modular design, where code is organized into reusable units called modules.  This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

### a. Core Modules

*   **Definition:**  Built-in modules that provide fundamental functionality.  They are part of the Node.js installation and don't require separate installation.
*   **Key Examples (and what they do):**
    *   `fs`:  File system operations (reading, writing, deleting files and directories).
    *   `http` / `https`:  Creating HTTP(S) servers and clients.
    *   `path`:  Manipulating and interacting with file paths.
    *   `os`:  Operating system-related utility methods (getting CPU info, memory usage, etc.).
    *   `events`:  The foundation of Node.js's event-driven architecture (the `EventEmitter` class).
    *   `util`:  Utility functions (e.g., `promisify` for converting callback-based functions to promise-based).
    *   `url`: Parsing and manipulating URLs.
    *   `querystring`:  Parsing and formatting URL query strings.
    *   `crypto`: Cryptographic functions (hashing, encryption).
    *   `zlib`: Compression and decompression.

*   **Example (using `fs`):**

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');

    // Synchronous file write (generally avoid in favor of asynchronous)
    fs.writeFileSync('test.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!');

    // Asynchronous file read (preferred)
    fs.readFile('test.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err);
        return;
      }
      console.log('File content:', data);
    });
    ```

### b. Local Modules

*   **Definition:** Modules that *you* create within your Node.js project.  They allow you to organize your application's code into logical units.

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // math.js (our local module)
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }

    function subtract(a, b) {
      return a - b;
    }

    module.exports = {
      add,      // Shorthand property name (ES6)
      subtract,
    };

    // app.js (using the local module)
    const math = require('./math'); // Relative path to the module file
    console.log(math.add(5, 10));     // Output: 15
    console.log(math.subtract(10, 3)); // Output: 7
    ```

### c. Third-Party Modules

*   **Definition:** Modules published to the NPM registry (or other package repositories) by other developers.  These extend the functionality of your Node.js applications.

*   **Example:**

    ```bash
    # Install the 'express' package (a popular web framework)
    npm install express
    ```

    ```javascript
    // app.js
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello from Express!');
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server running on port 3000');
    });
    ```

### d. `module.exports`

*   **Definition:**  The mechanism for *exporting* functionality from a CommonJS module (the module system used by Node.js by default).  Whatever you assign to `module.exports` is what will be returned when another file `require()`s your module.

*   **Examples:**

    ```javascript
    // Exporting a single function
    module.exports = function(x) {
      return x * 2;
    };

    // Exporting an object with multiple properties
    module.exports = {
      name: 'My Module',
      greet: function(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
      },
    };

    // Exporting a class
    class MyClass {
      // ...
    }
    module.exports = MyClass;
    ```

### e. `require`

*   **Definition:** The function used to *import* a module in CommonJS.  It takes the module's path (or name, for core and third-party modules) as an argument and returns the module's exported content (the value of `module.exports`).

*   **Examples:**

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs'); // Core module
    const myModule = require('./my-module'); // Local module (relative path)
    const express = require('express'); // Third-party module (from node_modules)
    ```

### f. ESM (ECMAScript Modules)

*   **Definition:** The standard module system for JavaScript (used in browsers and increasingly in Node.js).  It uses the `import` and `export` keywords.

*   **Enabling ESM in Node.js:**
    *   Use the `.mjs` file extension.
    *   Set `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
    *   Use the `--experimental-modules` flag (older Node.js versions).

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // math.mjs
    export function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }

    export const PI = 3.14159;

    // app.mjs
    import { add, PI } from './math.mjs';

    console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
    console.log(PI);        // Output: 3.14159
    ```

* **Key Differences (CommonJS vs. ESM):**
    *   **Syntax:** `require`/`module.exports` vs. `import`/`export`.
    *   **Loading:** CommonJS is synchronous; ESM is asynchronous (can improve performance).
    * **Top-Level Await**: Only work in ESM.
    *   **`__dirname` and `__filename`:**  Not directly available in ESM (you can construct them using `import.meta.url`).
    *   **Interoperability:**  Mixing CommonJS and ESM can be tricky, but Node.js provides ways to make them work together.

---

## 12. NPM (Node Package Manager)

### a. Local & Global Packages

*   **Local Packages:**
    *   Installed within a specific project's directory (inside the `node_modules` folder).
    *   Used only by that project.
    *   Declared as dependencies in the project's `package.json` file.
    *   Installed using `npm install <package-name>`.

    ```bash
    npm install lodash  # Installs lodash locally in the current project
    ```

*   **Global Packages:**
    *   Installed system-wide (usually in a central location).
    *   Available to all projects on your system.
    *   Often used for command-line tools.
    *   Installed using `npm install -g <package-name>` (or `npm install --global <package-name>`).

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon  # Installs nodemon globally
    ```

*   **Best Practice:**  Generally prefer local installations for project dependencies to avoid version conflicts and ensure consistent environments.  Use global installations sparingly, primarily for command-line tools you use across multiple projects.

### b. `npm init`

*   **Definition:**  Initializes a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file.
*   **`package.json`:**  A JSON file that contains metadata about your project, including:
    *   Project name and version
    *   Description
    *   Entry point (main file)
    *   Scripts (e.g., start, test)
    *   Dependencies (local packages)
    *   DevDependencies (packages used for development, testing, etc.)
    *   Author and license information

*   **Usage:**

    ```bash
    npm init  # Interactive mode - prompts you for information
    npm init -y  # (or --yes) Creates a package.json with default values
    ```

---

## 13. Installing & Running Nodemon

*   **Definition:** `nodemon` is a utility that automatically restarts your Node.js application whenever it detects file changes in your project directory.  This is extremely useful during development, as you don't have to manually restart the server after every code change.

*   **Installation (usually globally for convenience):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    ```

*   **Usage:**

    ```bash
    nodemon your_app.js  # Replace your_app.js with your main server file
    ```

### a. Scripts in `package.json`

*   **Definition:** The `scripts` field in `package.json` allows you to define custom command-line scripts for your project.  This makes it easy to automate common tasks.

*   **Example:**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js",  // Standard "start" script
        "dev": "nodemon index.js", // Development script using nodemon
        "test": "jest"             // Run tests using Jest
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.17.1"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "nodemon": "^2.0.15",
        "jest": "^27.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Running Scripts:** Use `npm run <script-name>`.

    ```bash
    npm run start  # Runs `node index.js`
    npm run dev    # Runs `nodemon index.js`
    npm run test   # Runs `jest`
    ```

    *   **Special Case: `npm start`:** You can run the `start` script directly with `npm start` (without `run`).

---

## 15. `package-lock.json` vs. `package.json`

*   **`package.json`:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Describes your project and its dependencies at a *high level*.
    *   **Dependency Versions:**  Uses *semantic versioning* (semver) to specify allowed version ranges for dependencies (e.g., `^4.17.1` means any version from 4.17.1 up to, but not including, 5.0.0).
    *   **Human-Readable:**  Intended to be read and edited by developers.

*   **`package-lock.json`:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Provides a *precise record* of the *exact* versions of all dependencies (including nested dependencies) that were installed at a specific point in time.
    *   **Dependency Versions:**  Specifies the *exact* version of each package (e.g., `4.17.1`).
    *   **Reproducible Builds:**  Ensures that everyone working on the project, and every deployment environment, uses the *same* set of dependencies, preventing unexpected issues caused by different package versions.
    *   **Automatically Generated:**  Created and updated by NPM automatically when you install or update packages.  You should *not* edit this file manually.
* **yarn.lock** Yarn creates yarn.lock file to keep information about exact versions.

*   **Key Takeaway:**  `package.json` defines the *desired* dependencies; `package-lock.json` records the *actual* installed dependencies.  Always commit both files to your version control system.

---

## 16. Event Loop

*   **Definition:** The event loop is the core mechanism that enables Node.js's asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model.  It's a continuously running loop that processes events and executes callbacks.

*   **Simplified Explanation (Step-by-Step):**

    1.  **Synchronous Code:** Node.js executes any synchronous code immediately.
    2.  **Event Queue:**  Asynchronous operations (like reading a file, making a network request, or setting a timer) are registered with the system (via `libuv`).  When these operations are initiated, a callback function is associated with them.
    3.  **Non-Blocking I/O:**  Node.js *doesn't wait* for these asynchronous operations to complete.  It immediately moves on to the next task.
    4.  **Event Loop Iteration:**  The event loop continuously checks for completed I/O operations (and other events).
    5.  **Callback Execution:** When an asynchronous operation completes, its associated callback function is placed in the *event queue*.  The event loop, at the next opportunity, picks up the callback from the queue and executes it.
    6.  **Phases:** The event loop has multiple phases, each with its own queue:
        *   **Timers:**  Callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
        *   **Pending Callbacks:**  Callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
        *   **Idle, Prepare:**  Internal Node.js operations.
        *   **Poll:**  Retrieves new I/O events; this is where the event loop spends most of its time when waiting for I/O.
        *   **Check:**  `setImmediate` callbacks are invoked here.
        *   **Close Callbacks:**  Callbacks for 'close' events (e.g., a socket closing).

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    console.log('Start'); // 1. Synchronous - executes immediately

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Timeout'); // 2. Timer - callback added to timers queue
    }, 0);

    fs.readFile('some-file.txt', (err, data) => { // 3. I/O - callback added to poll queue
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('File read');
    });

    console.log('End'); // 4. Synchronous - executes immediately

    // Possible Output (order may vary slightly):
    // Start
    // End
    // Timeout  (or File read, depending on how fast the file is read)
    // File read (or Timeout)
    ```

---

## 17. Event Queue

*   **Definition:** A data structure (usually a FIFO queue) that holds callback functions that are ready to be executed by the event loop.  Different phases of the event loop have their own queues.

*   **Role:** The event queue acts as a waiting area for callbacks.  When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is added to the appropriate queue.  The event loop then picks up callbacks from these queues and executes them.

---

## 18. Events in Node.js

*   **Definition:** Node.js is built around an event-driven architecture.  Many core objects in Node.js emit events, and you can create your own custom events.  This allows you to write code that reacts to specific occurrences in your application.

*   **`EventEmitter`:** The core class for working with events.

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const EventEmitter = require('events');

    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {} // Create a custom class

    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    // Register an event listener (handler)
    myEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    });

    // Emit (trigger) the event
    myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
    myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Bob');   // Output: Hello, Bob!

    //Error Handling
    myEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
        console.error('An error occurred:', err);
    });

    ```

*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `on(eventName, listener)`:  Registers a listener function to be called when the specified event is emitted.
    *   `emit(eventName, ...args)`:  Emits (triggers) the specified event, passing any provided arguments to the listeners.
    *   `once(eventName, listener)`:  Registers a listener that is only called *once*.
    *   `removeListener(eventName, listener)`:  Removes a specific listener.
    *   `removeAllListeners([eventName])`:  Removes all listeners (or all listeners for a specific event).
    *   Always add 'error' listener.

# Node.js: Events, HTTP, Streams, and Buffers

This document delves into key Node.js concepts: Event Emitters, the `http` module, Streams, and Buffers, providing detailed explanations and practical examples.

## 1. Event Emitters

*   **Core Concept:** Node.js follows an event-driven architecture. The `events` module provides the `EventEmitter` class, which is the foundation for this architecture. Objects that inherit from `EventEmitter` can emit named events that cause registered listener functions to be called.

### a. `on`, `emit`

*   **`on(eventName, listener)`:**  Registers a listener function (`listener`) to be called when an event with the name `eventName` is emitted.  You can have multiple listeners for the same event.

*   **`emit(eventName, ...args)`:**  Triggers the event named `eventName`.  Any additional arguments (`...args`) are passed to the listener functions.

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const EventEmitter = require('events');

    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {} // Create a custom class

    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    // Register a listener for the 'greet' event
    myEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    });

    // Emit the 'greet' event with different arguments
    myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
    myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Bob');   // Output: Hello, Bob!

    // Multiple listeners
    myEmitter.on('greet', () => {
        console.log('Another greeting!');
    });

    myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Zameer'); // Output: Hello, Zameer! \n Another Greetting

    // Listener that fires only once
    myEmitter.once('event2', () => {
        console.log("Event2 triggered once");
    });
    myEmitter.emit('event2'); // "Event2 triggered once"
    myEmitter.emit('event2'); // This will not trigger the listener again.

    // Remove Listener
     const listener1 = (data) => {
        console.log('Listener 1:', data);
    };
    myEmitter.on('event1', listener1);

    myEmitter.removeListener('event1', listener1);
    myEmitter.emit('event1', 'world'); // Nothing will log, Listener 1 removed

    //Error Handling
    myEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
        console.error('An error occurred:', err);
    });
    myEmitter.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong!')); // 'An error occurred: Error: Something went wrong!'

    ```

*   **Key Methods (beyond `on` and `emit`):**
    *   `once(eventName, listener)`:  Registers a listener that's called at most once.  It's automatically removed after it's called.
    *   `removeListener(eventName, listener)`:  Removes a *specific* listener function.  It's crucial to pass the *same* function reference that you used with `on`.
    *   `removeAllListeners([eventName])`:  Removes all listeners, or all listeners for a specific event.
    *   `listenerCount(eventName)`: Returns the number of listeners for a given event.
    *   `eventNames()`: Returns an array of the names of all events that have listeners.

*   **Best Practices (Memory Leaks):**  A common source of memory leaks in Node.js applications is forgetting to remove event listeners when they are no longer needed.  If you attach a listener to an object that lives longer than the listener itself, the listener (and anything it references) will not be garbage collected.
    * Always remove listeners that won't be used.

## 2. HTTP Module

*   **Core Concept:** The `http` module provides the functionality to create HTTP servers and clients.  It's a low-level module; for most web application development, frameworks like Express.js are used, but understanding the `http` module is essential for understanding how Node.js handles network communication.

### a. Creating a Simple Server

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // req: IncomingMessage object (represents the client's request)
  // res: ServerResponse object (represents the server's response)

  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }); // Set status code and headers
  res.end('Hello, world!\n'); // Send the response body and end the response
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

*   **`http.createServer(requestListener)`:**  Creates an `http.Server` instance.  The `requestListener` is a function that's automatically added as a listener for the `'request'` event.  This function is called *every time* an HTTP request is received.

*   **`req` (IncomingMessage):**
    *   `req.url`:  The requested URL path (e.g., `/about`, `/products?id=123`).
    *   `req.method`:  The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    *   `req.headers`:  An object containing the request headers.
    *   `req` is also a *Readable Stream* (see Streams section below), so you can read data from the request body.

*   **`res` (ServerResponse):**
    *   `res.writeHead(statusCode, [statusMessage], [headers])`:  Sends the response headers (status code, content type, etc.).
    *   `res.write(chunk, [encoding], [callback])`:  Sends a chunk of the response body.  Can be called multiple times.
    *   `res.end([data], [encoding], [callback])`:  Signals that the server has finished sending the response.  Optionally, you can send a final chunk of data.
    *   `res` is also a *Writable Stream*.

* **Handling different HTTP methods and routes:**

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url, true);
    const path = parsedUrl.pathname;
    const method = req.method;
  if (path === '/' && method === 'GET') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Home Page');
  } else if (path === '/about' && method === 'GET') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('About Page');
  } else if (path === '/api/data' && method === 'POST') {
    let body = '';
    req.on('data', (chunk) => {
      body += chunk.toString();
    });
    req.on('end', () => {
      try {
        const jsonData = JSON.parse(body);
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
        res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Data received', data: jsonData }));
      } catch (error) {
        res.writeHead(400, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
        res.end('Invalid JSON');
      }
    });
  }
  else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Not Found');
  }
    req.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Internal Server Error');
  });
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## 3. Streams

*   **Core Concept:** Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling data in a memory-efficient way.  Instead of loading an entire file or dataset into memory at once, streams allow you to process data *chunk by chunk*. This is essential for handling large files or network data.

### a. Types of Streams

1.  **Writable Streams:**  Streams to which you can *write* data.
    *   Examples:
        *   `fs.createWriteStream()` (writing to a file)
        *   `res` (the `ServerResponse` object in the `http` module - you write the response to the client)
        *   `process.stdout` (writing to the console)

2.  **Readable Streams:**  Streams from which you can *read* data.
    *   Examples:
        *   `fs.createReadStream()` (reading from a file)
        *   `req` (the `IncomingMessage` object in the `http` module - you read the request body)
        *   `process.stdin` (reading from the console)

3.  **Duplex Streams:**  Streams that are *both* readable and writable.
    *   Example:
        *   `net.Socket` (a TCP socket - you can both read from and write to the socket)

4.  **Transform Streams:**  A special type of Duplex stream that *modifies* or *transforms* the data as it passes through.
    *   Examples:
        *   `zlib.createGzip()` (compresses data)
        *   `zlib.createGunzip()` (decompresses data)
        *   `crypto.createCipheriv()` (encrypts data)
        *   `crypto.createDecipheriv()` (decrypts data)
    *   Custom Transform streams (you can create your own to perform any kind of data transformation).

### b. `createReadStream()`

*   **`fs.createReadStream(path, [options])`:**  Creates a `ReadStream` object for reading data from a file.
    *   `path`: The path to the file.
    *   `options`: An object with various options, including:
        *   `encoding`:  The character encoding (e.g., 'utf8', 'ascii', 'base64').  If not specified, the data will be emitted as `Buffer` objects.
        *   `highWaterMark`:  The number of bytes (or objects, for object mode) to buffer before pausing the stream.
        * `start`, `end`

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');

    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('large_file.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });

    readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
      console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
      // Process the chunk of data
    });

    readStream.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Finished reading file');
    });

    readStream.on('error', (err) => {
      console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    });
    ```

### c. `readFile` vs. `readFileSync`

*   **`fs.readFile(path, [options], callback)`:**  Reads the *entire* contents of a file *asynchronously*.  The `callback` function is called once the entire file has been read (or an error occurs).

*   **`fs.readFileSync(path, [options])`:**  Reads the *entire* contents of a file *synchronously*.  The function *blocks* until the file has been read, and then returns the file contents.

*   **Key Differences and When to Use:**

    | Feature       | `fs.readFile`                     | `fs.readFileSync`                       |
    | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | Asynchronous? | Yes                                | No (synchronous)                       |
    | Blocking?     | No                                 | Yes                                     |
    | Use Case      | Preferred for most situations.     | Avoid unless absolutely necessary.       |
    |               | Does not block the event loop.     | Can significantly impact performance. |
    |               | Allows other operations to proceed. |                                         |

    *   **Recommendation:**  Almost always use `fs.readFile` (the asynchronous version) in your Node.js applications.  `fs.readFileSync` should only be used in very specific situations where you *need* synchronous behavior (e.g., during application startup to load configuration files *before* starting the server).  Using `readFileSync` in the middle of your application's request handling will block the event loop and make your server unresponsive.

### d. `pipe()`

*   **`readable.pipe(writable, [options])`:**  The `pipe()` method is the most convenient way to connect streams together.  It takes a *readable* stream and connects it to a *writable* stream, automatically handling the flow of data, backpressure, and errors.

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');

    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

    readStream.pipe(writeStream); // Pipe the data from input.txt to output.txt

    // Handle errors (important!)
    readStream.on('error', (err) => {
      console.error('Error reading:', err);
    });
    writeStream.on('error', (err) => {
      console.error('Error writing:', err);
    });
      writeStream.on('finish', () => {
        console.log('File copied successfully!');
    });
    ```
* **Transform Stream Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const { Transform } = require('stream');

// Create a readable stream
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt', 'utf8');

// Create a writable stream
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Create a transform stream to convert to uppercase
const toUpperCase = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    try {
      const transformedChunk = chunk.toString().toUpperCase();
      this.push(transformedChunk);
      callback();
    } catch (err) {
      callback(err);
    }
  },
});

readStream.pipe(toUpperCase).pipe(writeStream);

readStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error reading file:', err);
});
writeStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error writing to file:', err);
});
toUpperCase.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error transforming data:', err);
});
writeStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('File transformation complete!');
});
```

*   **Backpressure:**  `pipe()` automatically handles *backpressure*.  If the writable stream is slower than the readable stream, the readable stream will be paused until the writable stream can catch up.  This prevents the application from running out of memory.

### e. Buffers

*   **Definition:**  Buffers are used to represent binary data in Node.js.  Since JavaScript doesn't have native support for binary data, the `Buffer` class provides a way to work with raw bytes.

*   **Creating Buffers:**

    ```javascript
    // From a string
    const buf1 = Buffer.from('hello', 'utf8');

    // From an array of bytes
    const buf2 = Buffer.from([0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]); // 'hello' in ASCII

    // Allocating a buffer of a specific size (filled with zeros)
    const buf3 = Buffer.alloc(10);

    // Allocating a buffer (uninitialized - may contain old data!)
    const buf4 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);
    ```
* **Difference between `Buffer.alloc` and `Buffer.allocUnsafe`**
    *   `Buffer.alloc(size)`: Allocates a new buffer of the specified size and *initializes* it with zeros. This is slower than `allocUnsafe` because it takes the extra step of filling the buffer, but it's safer because you know the buffer contains only zeros.

    *   `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)`: Allocates a new buffer of the specified size, but *does not* initialize it. This means the buffer may contain *old data* from previously allocated memory. It's faster than `alloc`, but you must be careful to overwrite the entire buffer with your own data before using it, or you might expose sensitive information.

    * **When to use which:**
      *   Use `Buffer.alloc` when you need a buffer initialized to zeros, or when you're not sure if you'll be overwriting the entire buffer.
      *   Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe` *only* when you need maximum performance *and* you are absolutely sure that you will be writing to every byte of the buffer before reading from it.  If you don't overwrite the entire buffer, you risk leaking sensitive data.

* **Example where allocUnsafe's behavior is noticeable:**
    ```javascript
    const unsafeBuf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);
    console.log(unsafeBuf); // Output: (might contain old data) <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>

    unsafeBuf.write("hello");
    console.log(unsafeBuf) // Output: <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f 00 00 00 00 00>
    // Note: Only the first 5 bytes are overwritten.
    // The remaining bytes still contain the old data.
    console.log(unsafeBuf.toString()) // Output: hello

    //If we try to read more than 5 bytes, old data leaks
    const allocBuf = Buffer.alloc(10);
    console.log(allocBuf) // Output: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
    ```

*   **Common Buffer Methods:**
    *   `buf.toString([encoding], [start], [end])`:  Converts the buffer to a string.
    *   `buf.write(string, [offset], [length], [encoding])`:  Writes a string to the buffer.
    *   `buf.length`:  The size of the buffer (in bytes).
    *   `buf.slice([start], [end])`:  Creates a new buffer that references a portion of the original buffer (similar to array slicing).
    *   `Buffer.concat([list], [totalLength])`:  Concatenates an array of buffers into a single buffer.
    *   `buf.equals(otherBuffer)`:  Checks if two buffers have the same contents.
* **Example Buffer.concat:**
```javascript
const buf1 = Buffer.from('hello');
const buf2 = Buffer.from(' ');
const buf3 = Buffer.from('world');

const combinedBuf = Buffer.concat([buf1, buf2, buf3]);
console.log(combinedBuf.toString()); // Output: hello world
```
* **Decoding buffers:**
```javascript
const buffer = Buffer.from('SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=', 'base64');
console.log(buffer.toString('utf8')); // Output: Hello World

const asciiBuffer = Buffer.from([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]); // ASCII for "Hello"
console.log(asciiBuffer.toString('ascii')); // Output: Hello
```

### f. `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`

*   **Definition:**  `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is an HTTP header that indicates that the response body will be sent in a series of *chunks*.  This is used when the server doesn't know the total size of the response body in advance (e.g., when streaming data).

*   **How it Works:**
    1.  **Header:**  The server sends the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header in the response.
    2.  **Chunks:**  The response body is sent as a series of chunks.  Each chunk is preceded by its size (in hexadecimal), followed by a newline (`\r\n`), and then the chunk data itself.
    3.  **Terminator:**  The response ends with a zero-length chunk (i.e., `0\r\n`) followed by another newline (`\r\n`).

*   **Example (Conceptual - you don't usually construct this manually):**

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Content-Type: text/plain

    4\r\n        // Chunk size: 4 bytes
    Wiki\r\n     // Chunk data: "Wiki"
    5\r\n        // Chunk size: 5 bytes
    pedia\r\n   // Chunk data: "pedia"
    e\r\n        // Chunk size: 14 bytes (hexadecimal 'e' = 14)
     in \r\n
    \r\n         //Empty
    chunks.\r\n  // Chunk data: " in \r\n\r\nchunks."
    0\r\n        // Zero-length chunk (terminator)
    \r\n         // Final newline
    ```
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Streaming:**  Allows the server to start sending data before the entire response is ready.
    *   **Unknown Content Length:**  Doesn't require the server to know the `Content-Length` in advance.
    *   **Efficiency:**  Can be more efficient than buffering the entire response in memory.

*   **Node.js and `chunked` Encoding:**  Node.js's `http` module handles `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` automatically. When you use `res.write()` to send data in chunks, Node.js will automatically use chunked encoding if you haven't set a `Content-Length` header.  Similarly, when you receive a response with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, Node.js will automatically decode the chunks as they arrive. You don't need to manually parse the chunked format.

This comprehensive guide covers events, the HTTP module, streams (including different types and their uses), buffers, and the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header in Node.js. It provides clear explanations, practical examples, and best practices, preparing you for both interviews and real-world development scenarios.


















# Node.js: Cron Jobs and CORS

This document covers two important topics in Node.js development: Cron jobs and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

## 20. Cron Jobs

*   **Definition:** A cron job is a time-based task scheduler. It allows you to schedule commands or scripts to run automatically at specific times or intervals. Cron jobs are commonly used for tasks like:
    *   Sending automated emails.
    *   Backing up databases.
    *   Generating reports.
    *   Cleaning up temporary files.
    *   Running periodic data synchronization tasks.

*   **Node.js and Cron:** While cron is a standard Unix utility, you can use Node.js modules like `node-cron` to create and manage cron jobs directly within your Node.js applications. This is often preferred for portability and ease of management.

### a. The Cron Syntax: `* * * * *`

The cron schedule is defined using a string with five (or sometimes six) fields, separated by spaces. Each field represents a unit of time:

| Field        | Description       | Allowed Values |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 1st `*`      | Second (optional) | 0-59           |

### b, c, d, e, f, g. Field Explanations (See Table Above)

### h, i, j. Special Characters (See Above)

* **Time Zone:**
    *   Cron jobs typically run in the server's local time zone.
    *    `node-cron` allows you to specify a time zone for your cron jobs. This is *crucial* for applications that need to run tasks at specific times in different time zones.

* **Validation:**
    * It's important to validate your cron schedule strings to prevent errors.
    * `node-cron` provides a `validate` method to verify the syntax.

*   **Example (`node-cron`):**

    ```javascript
    const cron = require('node-cron');

    // Schedule a task to run every minute
    const task1 = cron.schedule('* * * * *', () => {
      console.log('Running every minute');
    });

    // Schedule a task to run every day at 3:00 AM in the 'America/Los_Angeles' time zone
    const task2 = cron.schedule('0 3 * * *', () => {
      console.log('Running every day at 3:00 AM Pacific Time');
    }, {
      scheduled: true, // Set to true to enable scheduling
      timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'
    });

      const task3 = cron.schedule('*/2 * * * *', () => { // Every two minutes.
        console.log('running every two minutes');
    },
      {
        scheduled: false //Not Scheduled, will not automatically start
    });

    task3.start() // Starts

    // Validate a cron string
    const isValid = cron.validate('*/5 * * * *'); // true
    const isNotValid = cron.validate('*/5 * * * * * * *'); //false
    console.log({isValid, isNotValid})

    // Stop a task
    // task1.stop();

    // Destroy task.
    // task1.destroy()
    ```

    *   **`cron.schedule(schedule, callback, [options])`:**
        *   `schedule`: The cron schedule string.
        *   `callback`: The function to execute when the schedule is triggered.
        *   `options`:  An optional object with settings:
            *   `scheduled`: (boolean) Whether to start the task immediately (default: `true`).
            *   `timezone`: (string) The time zone for the schedule.

## 21. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

*   **Definition:** CORS is a browser security mechanism that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one from which the web page originated.  This is a crucial security feature to prevent malicious websites from accessing data from other sites without permission.

*   **Same-Origin Policy:** Browsers enforce the same-origin policy, which means that a web page can only make requests to the same origin (protocol, domain, and port) as the page itself.  For example:

    *   `https://example.com/page1` can make requests to `https://example.com/api/data`.
    *   `https://example.com/page1` *cannot* make requests to `https://api.anotherdomain.com` (different domain) without CORS.
    *   `https://example.com/page1` *cannot* make requests to `http://example.com` (different protocol) without CORS.
    *   `https://example.com:8080/page1` *cannot* make requests to `https://example.com` (different port) without CORS.

*   **How CORS Works:** When a web page tries to make a cross-origin request, the browser:

    1.  **Simple Requests:** For "simple" requests (GET, HEAD, POST with certain content types), the browser sends the request directly.  If the server responds with the appropriate CORS headers (specifically `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`), the browser allows the response to be used by the web page.

    2.  **Preflighted Requests (OPTIONS):** For more complex requests (e.g., PUT, DELETE, requests with custom headers, or requests with `Content-Type` values other than `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`), the browser sends a "preflight" request using the `OPTIONS` HTTP method. This preflight request asks the server if the actual request is allowed.

### a. Preflight Request

*   **Purpose:** The preflight request (`OPTIONS`) checks with the server to see if the actual request (e.g., a `PUT` or `DELETE`) is permitted.  This is a security measure to prevent potentially harmful cross-origin requests.

*   **Headers:** The preflight request includes headers that describe the actual request that the browser intends to make:

    *   `Origin`:  The origin of the web page making the request (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    *   `Access-Control-Request-Method`:  The HTTP method of the actual request (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`).
    *   `Access-Control-Request-Headers`:  A comma-separated list of any custom headers that the actual request will include (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`).

*   **Server Response (Preflight):** The server must respond to the `OPTIONS` request with appropriate headers to indicate whether the actual request is allowed. Key headers include:

    *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:  Specifies which origins are allowed to make the request.  Can be a specific origin (e.g., `https://example.com`) or `*` to allow any origin (generally not recommended for security reasons, especially if credentials are involved).
    *   `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`:  A comma-separated list of allowed HTTP methods (e.g., `PUT, DELETE, GET, POST`).
    *   `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`:  A comma-separated list of allowed request headers.
    *   `Access-Control-Max-Age`:  (Optional) Specifies how long (in seconds) the browser can cache the results of the preflight request.

*   **Example (Preflight Request and Response):**

    **Request (`OPTIONS`):**

    ```
    OPTIONS /api/data HTTP/1.1
    Origin: https://example.com
    Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
    Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
    ```

    **Response (200 OK):**

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, GET, POST, DELETE
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
    ```

*   **Node.js and CORS (Example using Express.js):**

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const cors = require('cors'); // Use the 'cors' middleware

    const app = express();

    // Enable CORS for all origins (for development - be more restrictive in production!)
    app.use(cors());

    // Enable CORS for a specific origin
    // app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://example.com' }));

    // Enable CORS with specific options
    /*
    const corsOptions = {
        origin: 'https://example.com',
        methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
        allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
    };
    app.use(cors(corsOptions));
    */

    app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
      res.json({ message: 'Data from the server!' });
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
    });
    ```
* **`cors` Middleware** It's better to use `cors` middleware to handle Cross Origin Resource Sharing.
* **Without `cors` Middleware**
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express()

    app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); // Allow all origins
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
        next()
    })
    //... rest of your server code.
```

# Node.js: Clustering, Multithreading, Child Processes, and Thread Pool

This document covers advanced Node.js concurrency concepts: clustering, worker threads, child processes, and the thread pool. These techniques are essential for building high-performance, scalable applications that can take advantage of multi-core CPUs.

## 22. Cluster

*   **Definition:** The `cluster` module in Node.js allows you to create multiple *processes* (workers) that share the same server port. This enables you to utilize multiple CPU cores, significantly improving the performance of your application, especially under heavy load.

*   **How it Works:**
    1.  **Master Process:** The original Node.js process becomes the *master* process.
    2.  **Worker Processes:** The master process forks (creates copies of) itself to create worker processes. Each worker runs in its own separate process and has its own event loop, memory space, and V8 instance.
    3.  **Shared Port:** The master process listens on a specified port. When a request comes in, the operating system's built-in load balancing distributes the request to one of the worker processes.
    4.  **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The master and worker processes can communicate with each other using a built-in IPC channel. This allows you to send messages and data between processes.

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const cluster = require('cluster');
    const http = require('http');
    const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length; // Get the number of CPU cores

    if (cluster.isMaster) {
      console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

      // Fork workers.
      for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork(); // Create a worker process
      }

      cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
        // You might want to fork a new worker here to replace the dead one
        cluster.fork();
      });
      cluster.on('online', (worker) => {
            console.log('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' is online');
        });
      cluster.on('listening', (worker, address) => {
            console.log('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' is listening on port ' + address.port);
        });
    } else {
      // Workers can share any TCP connection
      // In this case it is an HTTP server
      http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('hello world\n');
      }).listen(8000);

      console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
    }
    ```

    *   **`cluster.isMaster`:**  A boolean that's `true` in the master process and `false` in worker processes. This is how you determine which code to execute in each process.
    *   **`cluster.fork()`:**  Creates a new worker process.
    *   **`cluster.on('exit', ...)`:**  An event that's emitted when a worker process exits.
    *   **`cluster.on('online', ...)`:** An event emitted when worker is online.
    *    **`cluster.on('listening', ...)`:** An event emitted when worker start to listen.
    *   **`process.pid`:**  The process ID.

* **Advantages of Clustering:**
    *   **Improved Performance:** Utilizes multiple CPU cores, leading to better throughput and reduced response times under load.
    *   **Increased Reliability:** If one worker process crashes, the others can continue to handle requests.  The master process can also automatically restart crashed workers.
    *   **Zero-Downtime Deploys (with careful implementation):** You can deploy new code to your application without downtime by gracefully shutting down old workers and starting new ones.

* **Disadvantages of Clustering**
    * **More Complicated Architecture**: Setting up and deploying a cluster can be more complex than single threaded application
    * **Shared State**: You need to be more careful with shared states.

## 23. Multithreading in Node.js (Worker Threads)

*   **Definition:** Before Node.js 10.5, Node.js was primarily single-threaded (for the event loop).  Worker threads, introduced in later versions, provide a way to execute JavaScript code in *parallel* on multiple threads *within* a single Node.js process.

*   **Key Differences from Child Processes/Clustering:**
    *   **Shared Memory:** Worker threads within the same process can share memory using `SharedArrayBuffer` objects.  This can be more efficient than the inter-process communication (IPC) required for child processes.
    *   **Lower Overhead:** Creating worker threads is generally faster and has lower overhead than creating child processes.
    *   **Single Process:**  Worker threads run within the *same* Node.js process, whereas child processes and clusters create *separate* processes.

### a. `require('worker_threads')`

*   This module provides the API for working with worker threads.

### b. `new Worker`

*   **`new Worker(filename, [options])`:**  Creates a new worker thread.
    *   `filename`: The path to the JavaScript file that the worker thread will execute.
    *   `options`:  An optional object with settings:
        *   `workerData`:  Data to be passed to the worker thread (cloned).
        *   `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`:  Options for connecting the worker's standard input/output streams.

## 24. Thread Pool

* **Definition:** libuv (the C library that provides Node.js with its asynchronous I/O capabilities) uses a *thread pool* to handle certain operations that cannot be done asynchronously by the operating system.
* **Operations handled by Thread Pool:**
    * File System Operations: On most operating systems, file system operations are blocking.
    * DNS Lookups: `dns.lookup()` uses the thread pool.
    * CPU-Bound Tasks: You can offload CPU-intensive operations to the thread pool.
* **Default Size:** The default size of the thread pool is 4, but it can be adjusted using the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable (up to a maximum of 128).
    ```bash
    UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 node index.js #Starts with 8 threads.
    ```

*   **Important Note:**  The thread pool is *separate* from worker threads.  Worker threads are for running *JavaScript* code in parallel.  The thread pool is used internally by `libuv` to handle asynchronous operations that would otherwise block the event loop.

## 25. Worker Threads (Detailed Example)

### a. Creating a Worker

```javascript
// main.js (main thread)
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData: { value: 42 } });

worker.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Received message from worker:', message);
});

worker.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Worker error:', err);
});

worker.on('exit', (code) => {
  console.log(`Worker exited with code ${code}`);
});

// Send a message to the worker
worker.postMessage({ command: 'calculate', data: 10 });

```

```javascript
// worker.js (worker thread)
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

console.log('Worker data:', workerData); // { value: 42 }

parentPort.on('message', (message) => {
  if (message.command === 'calculate') {
    const result = message.data * 2; // Some CPU-bound calculation
    parentPort.postMessage({ result: result }); // Send the result back to the main thread
  }
});
```

### b. `parentPort`

*   **`parentPort`:**  In the worker thread, `parentPort` is a `MessagePort` object that allows the worker to communicate with the main thread.
    *   `parentPort.postMessage(value)`:  Sends a message to the main thread.
    *   `parentPort.on('message', (message) => { ... })`:  Registers a listener for messages from the main thread.

## 26. Cluster vs. Worker Threads

| Feature          | Cluster                                  | Worker Threads                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Processes        | Multiple processes                       | Single process                               |
| Memory           | Separate memory spaces                   | Shared memory (with `SharedArrayBuffer`)      |
| Communication    | Inter-Process Communication (IPC)        | `postMessage` (faster, can share memory)    |
| Overhead         | Higher (creating processes)              | Lower (creating threads)                     |
| Use Case         | I/O-bound tasks, maximizing CPU utilization | CPU-bound tasks within a single application |
| Load Balancing   | OS-level load balancing                   | Manual distribution of work                  |
| Failure Isolation | High, one worker's crash doesn't affect others | Lower, a worker crash can affect the entire process if not handled|

*   **When to Use Which:**

    *   **Clustering:** Ideal for I/O-bound applications (like web servers) where you want to maximize throughput and resilience by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
    *   **Worker Threads:**  Best for CPU-bound tasks within a single application where you want to perform calculations in parallel without the overhead of creating separate processes.  Also useful when you need to share memory between threads.

## 27. Child Processes

*   **Definition:** Child processes allow you to run other programs (not just Node.js scripts) from your Node.js application. This is useful for tasks like:
    *   Running shell commands.
    *   Executing other programs.
    *   Performing tasks that are better suited for other languages.

### a. Methods

The `child_process` module provides several methods for creating child processes:

*   **`spawn()`:**  The most general-purpose method.  It launches a new process with the given command and arguments.  It's asynchronous and uses streams for input and output.
*   **`exec()`:**  Executes a command in a shell.  It buffers the command's output and provides it to a callback function.  Suitable for commands that produce a limited amount of output.
*   **`execFile()`:**  Similar to `exec()`, but it executes a file directly without using a shell.  This is more efficient and slightly more secure than `exec()`.
*   **`fork()`:**  A special case of `spawn()` that creates a new *Node.js* process and establishes a communication channel between the parent and child processes.

### b. `fork()`

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // parent.js
    const { fork } = require('child_process');

    const child = fork('./child.js');

    child.on('message', (message) => {
      console.log('Message from child:', message);
    });

    child.send({ hello: 'world' }); // Send a message to the child
    ```

    ```javascript
    // child.js
    process.on('message', (message) => {
      console.log('Message from parent:', message);
      process.send({ message: 'Hello from child!'});
    });
    ```

    * **Communication:** `fork()` automatically sets up an IPC channel between the parent and child processes, allowing you to send messages using `child.send()` and receive messages using `process.on('message')`.

### c. `exec()`

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const { exec } = require('child_process');

    exec('ls -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
        return;
      }
      console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
      console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    });
    ```

### d. `execFile()`

    ```javascript
    const { execFile } = require('child_process');
    const child = execFile('node', ['--version'], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log(stdout);
    });
    ```

### e. `spawn()`

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');

    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-l', '-h', '/usr']);

    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });

    ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
    });

    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });
    ```
    * **Streams:** `spawn()` returns a `ChildProcess` object with `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` properties, which are streams. This allows you to pipe data to and from the child process.

### f. `spawn` vs. `fork`

*   **`spawn`:**
    *   General-purpose: Can run *any* command.
    *   No built-in communication channel: You need to use streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) to communicate.
*   **`fork`:**
    *   Specific to Node.js: Creates a new *Node.js* process.
    *   Built-in communication channel: Uses `child.send()` and `process.on('message')` for easy message passing.

### g. `child_process.fork()` vs. `cluster.fork()`

*   **`child_process.fork()`:** Creates a *new* Node.js process with its own independent V8 instance and event loop.  Used for running separate Node.js scripts.
*   **`cluster.fork()`:** Creates a *worker* process that shares the same server port as the master process. Used for load balancing and utilizing multiple CPU cores for a single Node.js application.  The workers are specifically designed to work together in a clustered server environment.

This comprehensive guide covers clustering, worker threads, child processes, and the thread pool in Node.js. It provides detailed explanations, practical examples, and comparisons to help you understand these advanced concurrency concepts and use them effectively in your applications. This is essential knowledge for building high-performance and scalable Node.js applications.








# Node.js: HTTP, Security, and Networking

This document covers a range of topics related to HTTP, web security, and networking, focusing on aspects relevant to Node.js development.

## 28. HTTP

*   **Definition:** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It follows a client-server model, where a client (typically a web browser) sends a request to a server, and the server responds.

### a. HTTPS

*   **Definition:** HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. This protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### b. How does it work? (HTTPS)

1.  **Client Request:** The client (e.g., a browser) initiates a connection to the server and requests a secure connection (HTTPS).
2.  **Server Certificate:** The server responds by sending its SSL/TLS certificate to the client. This certificate contains the server's public key and is digitally signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
3.  **Certificate Verification:** The client verifies the certificate:
    *   **Validity:** Checks if the certificate is not expired and is within its valid date range.
    *   **CA Trust:** Verifies that the certificate is signed by a CA that the client trusts.  Browsers and operating systems have a built-in list of trusted CAs.
    *   **Domain Match:** Ensures that the certificate's domain name matches the website's domain name.
4.  **Key Exchange:** If the certificate is valid, the client generates a *symmetric session key*. This key will be used for encrypting and decrypting the data exchanged during the session.
5.  **Encryption:** The client encrypts the session key using the server's *public key* (obtained from the certificate) and sends the encrypted session key to the server.
6.  **Decryption:** The server decrypts the session key using its *private key*. Only the server can do this, as it's the only one with the private key.
7.  **Secure Communication:** Now that both the client and server have the same *symmetric session key*, they use this key to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communication.

### c. SSL Certificate Working

*   **Public/Private Key Pair:** SSL/TLS certificates rely on asymmetric cryptography, which uses a pair of keys:
    *   **Public Key:**  This key is distributed publicly (in the certificate).  It can be used to *encrypt* data, but *not* to decrypt it.
    *   **Private Key:**  This key is kept *secret* on the server. It can be used to *decrypt* data that was encrypted with the corresponding public key.
*   **Certificate Authority (CA):** A trusted third party that issues and verifies digital certificates.  CAs act as a trusted intermediary, vouching for the identity of the website.
*   **Certificate Chain:**  A certificate is often part of a chain of certificates, starting with the server's certificate and going up to a root CA certificate.  The client verifies the entire chain.

### d. Default Port

*   **HTTP:**  Port 80
*   **HTTPS:** Port 443

### e. Request-Response Cycle

1.  **Client Request:** The client (e.g., browser) sends an HTTP request to the server.
2.  **Server Processing:** The server receives the request, processes it (e.g., retrieves data from a database, executes server-side logic), and prepares a response.
3.  **Server Response:** The server sends an HTTP response back to the client.
4.  **Client Rendering:** The client (browser) receives the response and renders it (e.g., displays the HTML page, executes JavaScript).

### f. Stateless Protocol

*   **Definition:** HTTP is a *stateless* protocol. This means that each request from a client to a server is independent of any previous requests.  The server doesn't inherently retain any information about past interactions with the client.

*   **Implications:**  Statelessness simplifies server design and improves scalability, but it also means that mechanisms are needed to maintain state across multiple requests (e.g., for user sessions).

*   **Mechanisms for Maintaining State:**

    *   **Cookies:** Small pieces of data that the server sends to the client, and the client sends back with subsequent requests.  Used for session management, personalization, and tracking.
    *   **Local Storage/Session Storage:**  Web storage APIs that allow web pages to store data locally within the user's browser.  `localStorage` persists data even after the browser is closed; `sessionStorage` data is cleared when the session ends (e.g., the browser tab is closed).
    *   **URL Parameters:**  Data can be passed in the URL itself (e.g., `https://example.com/products?id=123`).
    *   **Hidden Form Fields:**  Data can be stored in hidden fields within HTML forms.
    * **Sessions (Server-Side):** The server can maintain session data (usually associated with a unique session ID stored in a cookie).  This is a common approach for managing user authentication and other session-specific information.

### g. Request Structure

An HTTP request consists of:

1.  **Start Line (Request Line):**
    *   **Method:** The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    *   **Request Target (URL):**  The path and any query parameters.
    *   **HTTP Version:**  The version of HTTP being used (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`).

    ```
    GET /products?id=123 HTTP/1.1
    ```

2.  **Headers:**  Key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request (e.g., `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Content-Type`, `Authorization`).

    ```
    Host: example.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```

3.  **Body (Optional):**  The data being sent with the request (e.g., form data, JSON data).  Used primarily with `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 99.99
    }
    ```

### h. Response Structure

An HTTP response consists of:

1.  **Start Line (Status Line):**
    *   **HTTP Version:** (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`).
    *   **Status Code:**  A three-digit code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
    *   **Status Text:**  A short textual description of the status code (e.g., `OK`, `Not Found`).

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ```

2.  **Headers:** Key-value pairs providing information about the response (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Set-Cookie`).

    ```
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 1234
    ```

3.  **Body:**  The actual data being returned (e.g., HTML content, JSON data, an image).

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Example Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

### i. HTTP Methods

*   **GET:**  Retrieves data from the server.  Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect (idempotent and safe).
*   **POST:**  Sends data to the server to create or update a resource.  Often used for submitting forms.
*   **PUT:**  Replaces an *entire* resource with the data provided in the request.  Idempotent.
*   **PATCH:**  Partially updates a resource.  Applies a set of changes to the resource.
*   **DELETE:**  Deletes a resource.  Idempotent.
*   **HEAD:**  Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers, not the response body.  Useful for checking if a resource exists or getting metadata without downloading the entire resource.
*   **CONNECT:**  Establishes a network connection to the server, often used for tunneling through proxies.
*   **OPTIONS:**  Retrieves the communication options available for a resource (e.g., which HTTP methods are allowed).  Used for CORS preflight requests.
*   **TRACE:**  Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.  Primarily used for debugging.

### j. Idempotent Methods

*   **Definition:** An idempotent method is one that has the same effect whether it's called once or multiple times.  In other words, repeated identical requests have the same result as a single request.

*   **Idempotent Methods:** `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`

*   **Non-Idempotent Methods:** `POST` is generally *not* idempotent, because multiple identical POST requests might create multiple resources.  `PATCH` *may* or *may not* be idempotent, depending on the specific implementation.

### k. Safe Methods

*  **Definition**: HTTP methods that can be regarded safe won't change state on the server.
*   **Safe Methods:**  `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`

### l. User-Agent

*   **Definition:** The `User-Agent` header is a request header that identifies the client making the request (e.g., the browser, operating system, and version).

*   **Example:**

    ```
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36
    ```

### m. Headers (Common Examples)

*   **`Host`:**  The domain name of the server (and optionally the port).
*   **`User-Agent`:** (See above).
*   **`Content-Type`:**  The media type of the request or response body (e.g., `application/json`, `text/html`, `image/jpeg`).
*   **`Content-Length`:**  The size of the response body (in bytes).
*   **`Authorization`:**  Credentials for authenticating the client with the server (e.g., `Basic`, `Bearer`).
*   **`Cookie`:**  Contains cookies sent by the client.
*   **`Set-Cookie`:**  Sent by the server to set cookies in the client.
*   **`Cache-Control`:**  Directives for caching mechanisms.
*   **`Accept`:**  Specifies the media types that the client can accept in the response.
*   **`Accept-Encoding`:**  Specifies the encodings (e.g., gzip, deflate) that the client can accept.
* **`Referer`**: Specifies the URL of the previous webpage from which a link was followed.

### n. `writeHead` vs. `setHeader`

*   **`res.writeHead(statusCode, [statusMessage], [headers])`:**  Sends the status code, status message, *and* headers to the client *in one go*.  You can only call `writeHead` *once* per response.
*   **`res.setHeader(name, value)`:**  Sets a *single* header value.  You can call `setHeader` multiple times to set different headers, but you must call it *before* you start sending the response body (i.e., before calling `res.write()` or `res.end()`).

*   **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // Using writeHead
    res.writeHead(200, {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
    });

    // Equivalent using setHeader
    res.statusCode = 200; // You can set the status code separately
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'value');
    ```

### o. Status Codes

*   **1xx (Informational):**  The request was received, and the server is continuing the process.
    *   `100 Continue`:  The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body.

*   **2xx (Successful):**  The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    *   `200 OK`:  The standard success response.
    *   `201 Created`:  The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created.
    *   `204 No Content`:  The server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to return.

*   **3xx (Redirection):**  Further action needs to be taken by the client to complete the request.
    *   `301 Moved Permanently`:  The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
    *   `302 Found` (or `307 Temporary Redirect`):  The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
    *   `304 Not Modified`:  The client's cached version of the resource is still valid, so the server doesn't send the full response.

*   **4xx (Client Error):**  The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
    *   `400 Bad Request`:  The server cannot understand the request due to invalid syntax.
    *   `401 Unauthorized`:  Authentication is required, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
    *   `403 Forbidden`:  The client does not have permission to access the resource.
    *   `404 Not Found`:  The requested resource could not be found on the server.
    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`:  The HTTP method used is not supported for the requested resource.

*   **5xx (Server Error):**  The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`:  A generic error message for server-side errors.
    *   `502 Bad Gateway`:  The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
    *   `503 Service Unavailable`:  The server is currently unavailable (e.g., due to overload or maintenance).
    *   `504 Gateway Timeout`: The server did not receive timely response.

### p. MIME Type (Media Type)

*   **Definition:** A MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions type) is a standard way to indicate the nature and format of a document, file, or data being transmitted over the internet.  It's used in the `Content-Type` header.

*   **Examples:**
    *   `text/html`:  HTML document
    *   `text/plain`:  Plain text
    *   `application/json`:  JSON data
    *   `application/xml`:  XML data
    *   `image/jpeg`:  JPEG image
    *   `image/png`:  PNG image
    *   `application/pdf`:  PDF document
    * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: URL-encoded form.
    * `multipart/form-data`: Used for forms that include file uploads.

### q. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

*   **HTTP/2:**
    *   **Binary Protocol:**  More efficient than the text-based HTTP/1.1.
    *   **Multiplexing:**  Multiple requests and responses can be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection.
    *   **Header Compression:**  Reduces header overhead.
    *   **Server Push:**  The server can proactively push resources to the client that it anticipates the client will need.

*   **HTTP/3:**
    *   **QUIC Transport Protocol:**  Uses QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of TCP, which can improve performance, especially in networks with packet loss.
    *   **Built-in Encryption:**  Encryption is mandatory.
    *   **Improved Multiplexing:**  Further improvements to multiplexing compared to HTTP/2.

### 29. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

*   **Definition:**  XSS is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Stored XSS:**  The malicious script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to other users.
    *   **Reflected XSS:**  The malicious script is included in a request (e.g., in a URL parameter) and reflected back by the server in the response.
    *   **DOM-based XSS:**  The vulnerability is in the client-side JavaScript code itself, which manipulates the DOM in an unsafe way based on user input.
* **Prevention:**
    * **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode output data (especially user-provided data) before displaying it in the browser.  This prevents the browser from interpreting the data as code. Use appropriate encoding for the context (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A browser security mechanism that allows you to specify which sources of content (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) are allowed to be loaded by the page.
    *   **HTTPOnly Cookies:**  Set the `HttpOnly` flag on cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side JavaScript.
    *   **Sanitization Libraries:** Use libraries like `DOMPurify` to sanitize HTML input, removing potentially harmful tags and attributes.

### 30. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

*   **Definition:** CSRF is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  The user is logged into a trusted website (e.g., their bank).
    2.  The user visits a malicious website or clicks on a malicious link.
    3.  The malicious website sends a forged request to the trusted website, using the user's existing session cookies.
    4.  The trusted website processes the request as if it came from the user, performing the attacker's desired action (e.g., transferring money, changing the user's password).
* **Prevention:**
    *   **CSRF Tokens:**  Include a unique, unpredictable, secret token in each form or request that requires authentication.  The server verifies that the token is present and correct before processing the request.
    *   **SameSite Cookies:**  Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to restrict how cookies are sent with cross-origin requests.  `SameSite=Strict` prevents the cookie from being sent with *any* cross-origin requests. `SameSite=Lax` allows some cross-origin requests (e.g., top-level navigations) but prevents others (e.g., requests from iframes).
    *   **Double Submit Cookie:**  Send a random value in both a cookie and a request parameter.  The server verifies that the values match.
    * **Verify the Referrer/Origin headers:** This isn't completely reliable.

### 31. MMA (I assume you might mean something like "Common Web Attacks", so I'll include a few more)

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS):**  Attacks that attempt to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):**  An attacker intercepts communication between two parties, eavesdropping on or modifying the data.  HTTPS helps prevent MitM attacks.

### 32. SQL Injection

*   **Definition:** SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's database layer. Attackers can insert malicious SQL code into input fields to gain unauthorized access to data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

*   **Example:**

    ```sql
    -- Vulnerable code (Node.js with a hypothetical database library)
    const username = req.body.username; // User input
    const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`; // Unsafe concatenation
    db.query(query, (err, results) => {
      // ...
    });

    -- Attacker's input:
    username = "'; DROP TABLE users; --";

    -- Resulting SQL query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'
    ```

### a. Prepared Statements

*   **Definition:** Prepared statements (also called parameterized queries) are a way to execute SQL queries with placeholders for values. The database driver separates the SQL code from the data, preventing SQL injection.

*   **Example (Node.js with `mysql2`):**

    ```javascript
    const mysql = require('mysql2/promise'); // Use the promise-based version

    async function getUser(username) {
      const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
        /* database connection details */
      });

      try {
        const [rows] = await connection.execute(
          'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', // Placeholder
          [username] // Parameter value
        );
        return rows;
      } finally {
        await connection.end();
      }
    }

    // Safe usage:
    getUser("'; DROP TABLE users; --") // This will NOT drop the table
        .then(data => console.log(data))
        .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```
* **Benefits of Prepared Statements:**
    * **Security:** Prevents SQL injection.
    * **Performance:** The database can pre-compile and cache the query plan, leading to faster execution for repeated queries with different parameters.
    *   **Readability:**  Makes SQL code cleaner and easier to understand.

### TCP and IP

* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
    *   **Connection-Oriented:**  Establishes a connection between the client and server before transmitting data.
    *   **Reliable:**  Ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. Uses acknowledgments and retransmissions.
    *   **Stream-Based:**  Data is transmitted as a continuous stream of bytes.
    * **Used By:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, SSH, and many other protocols.

*   **IP (Internet Protocol):**
    *   **Connectionless:**  Each packet is treated independently.
    *   **Unreliable:**  Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error-free transmission.
    *   **Packet-Based:**  Data is transmitted in packets.
    * **Used By:** All internet traffic.

*   **Relationship:** TCP runs *on top of* IP.  IP provides the basic mechanism for sending packets across the internet. TCP adds reliability and connection management on top of IP.  Think of IP as the postal service (delivering individual letters) and TCP as a registered mail service (guaranteeing delivery and order).

This document provides a comprehensive overview of HTTP, HTTPS, web security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection), and the underlying networking concepts of TCP and IP. It's tailored for a Node.js development context, with practical examples and explanations. This covers a large amount of ground important for building robust and secure web applications.
