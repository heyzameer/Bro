Summary of the Box Model
The CSS Box Model organizes how elements take up space on a webpage and interact with each other. It ensures clear spacing and layout structure through four layers:

Content: Holds the primary element, like text or images.

Padding: Creates internal space between the content and the border to enhance readability.

Border: Outlines the element, adding visual definition and separation.

Margin: Provides external space, separating the element from others to create a balanced layout.
