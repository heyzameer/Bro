Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the different types of CSS selectors with examples:

### 1. **Universal Selector (`*`)**
- **Definition**: Selects all elements in the document.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to apply a style to every element, such as resetting margin and padding.

**Example:**
```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```
This rule applies to all elements in the document, removing any default margins and padding.

### 2. **Type Selector (Element Selector)**
- **Definition**: Selects all elements of a specific type (e.g., all `<p>`, `<h1>`).
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to style all elements of a particular type uniformly, like all paragraphs or headings.

**Example:**
```css
p {
    font-size: 16px;
    color: black;
}
```
This rule applies to all `<p>` elements, setting their font size to `16px` and color to `black`.

### 3. **Class Selector (`.`)**
- **Definition**: Selects all elements with a specific class.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to apply styles to multiple elements that share the same class for consistent styling.

**Example:**
```css
.button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}
```
This rule applies to all elements with the class `button`.

```html
<button class="button">Click Me</button>
```

### 4. **ID Selector (`#`)**
- **Definition**: Selects a single element with a specific ID.
- **When to Use**: Use when you need to style a unique element, as IDs should be unique within a page.

**Example:**
```css
#header {
    background-color: lightgray;
    padding: 20px;
}
```
This rule applies to the element with the `id="header"`.

```html
<div id="header">Header Content</div>
```

### 5. **Attribute Selector**
- **Definition**: Selects elements based on their attributes or specific attribute values.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to style elements based on attributes, such as input fields with certain types (e.g., text).

**Example:**
```css
input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 5px;
}
```
This rule applies to all `<input>` elements with `type="text"`.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter text">
```

### 6. **Descendant Selector (Space)**
- **Definition**: Selects elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a specified element.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to target nested elements within a parent container, such as styling paragraphs within a div.

**Example:**
```css
div p {
    color: red;
}
```
This rule applies to all `<p>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>` element.

```html
<div>
    <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
```

### 7. **Child Selector (`>`)**
- **Definition**: Selects elements that are direct children of a specified element.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to style only the immediate children of an element, avoiding deeper nested elements.

**Example:**
```css
ul > li {
    list-style-type: square;
}
```
This rule applies to all `<li>` elements that are direct children of a `<ul>` element.

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

### 8. **Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`)**
- **Definition**: Selects an element that is directly adjacent to another specified element.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to style an element that comes immediately after another element, such as removing margins.

**Example:**
```css
h1 + p {
    margin-top: 0;
}
```
This rule applies to the first `<p>` element that immediately follows an `<h1>` element.

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>This paragraph has no top margin because it follows the heading.</p>
```

### 9. **General Sibling Selector (`~`)**
- **Definition**: Selects all siblings of a specified element that follow it.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to apply styles to all following siblings, not just the first one.

**Example:**
```css
h1 ~ p {
    color: gray;
}
```
This rule applies to all `<p>` elements that are siblings of an `<h1>` and come after it.

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>This paragraph is gray because it follows the heading.</p>
<p>This paragraph is also gray because it follows the heading.</p>
```

### 10. **Group Selector (`,`)**
- **Definition**: Applies the same styles to multiple selectors.
- **When to Use**: Use when you want to apply identical styles to multiple elements to keep your CSS concise and maintainable.

**Example:**
```css
h1, h2, p {
    color: blue;
}
```
This rule applies the color blue to all `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements.

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```
