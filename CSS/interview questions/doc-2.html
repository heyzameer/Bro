Here are the explanations for your CSS questions:

### 1. What is CSS Preprocessors? What is SCSS?
CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend CSS and compile it into regular CSS. They provide additional features such as variables, mixins, functions, and nested rules, making writing CSS more maintainable and scalable.

- **SCSS** (Sassy CSS) is a syntax of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), which is a CSS preprocessor. SCSS is fully compatible with CSS, meaning you can write regular CSS code and add additional SCSS features such as nesting and variables. SCSS files have a `.scss` extension.

### 2. What are the 3 types of CSS preprocessors?
The main types of CSS preprocessors are:
- **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)**: A powerful CSS extension that provides advanced features. It has two syntaxes: SCSS and indented syntax (old).
- **LESS**: A preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, mixins, and functions.
- **Stylus**: A feature-rich preprocessor that is more flexible than others and allows for a wide range of features like mixins, functions, and operators.

### 3. What are selectors in CSS? How many types of selectors in CSS?
Selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. There are several types of CSS selectors:
- **Universal Selector**: `*` (selects all elements)
- **Type Selector**: `p` (selects all `<p>` elements)
- **Class Selector**: `.className` (selects all elements with a specific class)
- **ID Selector**: `#idName` (selects a specific element with a given ID)
- **Attribute Selector**: `[type="text"]` (selects elements with a certain attribute)
- **Pseudo-classes**: `a:hover` (selects an element when it’s in a particular state)
- **Pseudo-elements**: `::before`, `::after` (selects parts of elements)

### 4. Explain the concept of Box Model in CSS?
The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements. It consists of the following parts:
- **Content**: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
- **Padding**: Space between the content and the border.
- **Border**: Surrounds the padding (if any) and content.
- **Margin**: Space outside the border, separating elements.

### 5. What is the difference between padding and margin?
- **Padding**: Space between the content and the border inside the element. It adds space **inside** the element.
- **Margin**: Space outside the border of the element. It adds space **outside** the element.

### 6. What is the difference between display: inline and display: block?
- **display: inline**: Elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as their content.
- **display: block**: Elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, stacking one on top of the other.

### 7. What is the z-index property in CSS? How do same z-index elements display?
The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of elements. Elements with higher `z-index` values will appear in front of elements with lower values.
- If multiple elements have the same `z-index`, they are stacked in the order they appear in the document (from top to bottom).

### 8. What is the difference between position: absolute/relative/fixed?
- **position: absolute**: The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (non-static). It’s removed from the document flow.
- **position: relative**: The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. It can be moved using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` without removing it from the flow.
- **position: fixed**: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, and stays in place even when the page is scrolled. It’s removed from the document flow.

### 9. What are Media Queries in CSS?
Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the properties of the device or viewport, such as screen size, orientation, or resolution. They are used for creating responsive designs.
Example:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

### 10. What is display: flex in CSS?
`display: flex` is a CSS layout model that allows you to easily align and distribute space among items in a container. It enables responsive and flexible layouts without having to use floats or positioning.
- Items inside a flex container are automatically aligned horizontally (row) or vertically (column).

### 11. What is CSS Grid Layout?
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns. You define the grid container and its tracks (rows and columns), and then place grid items into the grid. It’s very powerful for creating both simple and complex layouts.

Example:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}
```
This creates a 3-column grid layout where each column has equal width.
