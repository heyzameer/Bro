Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn
In 1974, Cerf and Kahn invented Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a set of protocols that govern how data moves through a network. Cerf is often called the "Father of the Internet". 
Tim Berners-Lee
In 1989, Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW), a way to access information on the internet. 
Paul Baran

The Origin of HTML
This document serves as an introduction to HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the essential building block for front-end development. As the first language you will encounter in your coding journey, understanding HTML is crucial for structuring and organizing content on web pages. This guide will cover the basics of HTML, its history, and its evolution, preparing you for the exciting world of web development.


Understanding HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is a markup language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Unlike programming languages, markup languages do not involve logic or computation; they simply organize and format text to be displayed correctly. HTML allows computers to interpret and present text in a structured format.

Key Concepts of HTML
Markup Language: A markup language is a type of computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. It organizes and formats text to ensure it displays correctly on web pages.


HTML Elements: In HTML, raw text is wrapped in HTML elements, which are tags that help the computer understand how to display the content. This enables the creation of well-structured and visually organized web pages.

HyperText: HyperText refers to text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, commonly known as hyperlinks. You've likely clicked on a few hyperlinks on your way to this course.
