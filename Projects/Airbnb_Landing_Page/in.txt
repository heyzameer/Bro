display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(200px,1fr));
    grid-gap:30px;

display: grid;
This enables the grid layout for the container, turning its children into grid items.

grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
This creates a responsive grid with dynamic columns:

repeat(auto-fit, ...): Automatically fits as many columns as possible in the available space.
minmax(200px, 1fr): Each column's width will be at least 200px but can grow to occupy one fractional unit (1fr) of the available space.
grid-gap: 30px;
This adds a 30px gap between the grid items (both rows and columns).

background-image: linear-gradient(to right,#3f2321,transparent),url(images/banner-2.png);
linear-gradient(to right, #3f2321, transparent):
This is a linear gradient that goes from left to right (to right).
The gradient starts with the color #3f2321 (a deep reddish-brown color) on the left and gradually becomes transparent towards the right.
The gradient creates a fade effect, and since it starts with a solid color and fades to transparency, it can be used to overlay on top of the background image for a subtle fade-out effect.
url(images/banner-2.png):
This applies a background image from the path images/banner-2.png (relative to your CSS or HTML file).



background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.3),rgba(0,0,0,0.3)),url(images/banner.png);linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.3), rgba(0,0,0,0.3)):

This creates a linear gradient from one color to another.
The color used here is rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), which is a semi-transparent black (rgba stands for Red, Green, Blue, Alpha).
The alpha value (0.3) indicates the transparency level: 0 is completely transparent, and 1 is fully opaque. 0.3 is partially transparent.

centering element in a div

.exclusives div{
    position: relative;
}
.exclusives div span{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}

**.exclusives div { position: relative; }

This sets the parent div in .exclusives as a relatively positioned container.
The position: relative; ensures that child elements with position: absolute; are positioned relative to this div.
**.exclusives div span { position: absolute; }

This positions the span absolutely within the bounds of the nearest ancestor that has position: relative; (the div in this case).
top: 50%; left: 50%;

These properties move the top-left corner of the span to the midpoint of the parent div.
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

The transform property shifts the span back by half of its own width and height, effectively centering it both horizontally and vertically.

Key Characteristics of display: inline;
Flows Horizontally: Inline elements flow along with the text and do not start on a new line.
No Width or Height: You cannot explicitly set width or height for inline elements. Their size depends on their content.
Spacing and Alignment: They respect the padding, margin, and border properties but only affect spacing horizontally, not vertically.
Default Inline Elements: Examples include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, etc.




Key Characteristics of display: block;
Takes Full Width: A block element takes up the entire width of its container, unless a width is specified.
Forces a New Line: Block-level elements are stacked vertically, unlike inline elements, which flow horizontally.
Customizable Dimensions: You can apply width, height, margin, padding, etc., to block elements.



Key Characteristics of display: inline-block;
Flows Inline: Similar to inline, it flows horizontally with other inline elements and does not break onto a new line.
Allows Box Model: Like block, you can explicitly set width, height, padding, margin, and border.
No Line Break: Unlike block, it doesn’t force a new line for itself or adjacent elements.

.active{
    position: relative;

}

.active::after{
    content: '';
    background: #fff;
    width: 25px;
    height:2px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    bottom: -12px;
    border-radius: 2px;
}

1. .active Class:
css
Copy code
.active{
    position: relative;
}
position: relative;: This is applied to the .active class. It allows you to position child elements (like ::after) relative to this element. The child element (::after) will be positioned based on the parent’s boundaries.
2. ::after Pseudo-Element:
css
Copy code
.active::after{
    content: '';
    background: #fff;
    width: 25px;
    height: 2px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    bottom: -12px;
    border-radius: 2px;
}
content: '';: The ::after pseudo-element generates an empty content block. Even though the content is empty, this block will still be visible because other styles (like background, width, and height) are applied.

background: #fff;: The background color of the ::after pseudo-element is set to white (#fff). You can change this color to suit your design.

width: 25px;: The width of the pseudo-element is 25 pixels.

height: 2px;: The height is 2 pixels, so this will be a very thin line.

position: absolute;: The ::after element is absolutely positioned with respect to the nearest positioned ancestor (in this case, .active since it's set to relative).

left: 50%;: This positions the element 50% from the left of its containing element (the .active element).

transform: translateX(-50%);: This moves the pseudo-element left by 50% of its own width to truly center it horizontally within its parent. Without this, the left edge would be at the 50% mark, but the element would not be centered.

bottom: -12px;: This moves the pseudo-element 12 pixels below the .active element, creating the appearance of a line beneath it.

border-radius: 2px;: This rounds the corners of the pseudo-element slightly, giving it a more polished, soft appearance.

    nav {
        position: fixed;
        top:0;
        z-index: 100;
        display: inline-block;
        width: 100%;
        padding: 100px 7% 0;
        background: #000;
        text-align: right;
        max-height: 100px;
        overflow: hidden;
        transition: max-height 0.5s;
    }




Explanation of Properties:
position: fixed;:

The nav element is fixed to the top of the viewport, meaning it stays in place even when the user scrolls.
top: 0;:

Positions the nav element at the top of the screen (relative to the viewport).
z-index: 100;:

The z-index ensures that the nav element appears above other elements on the page. A higher value places it in front of elements with lower z-index values.
display: inline-block;:

This makes the nav element behave like an inline element, but it also allows it to accept block-level styles (e.g., width, height). This is an unusual choice for a nav, as typically display: block; or display: flex; would be used, but inline-block will still work for layout purposes.
width: 100%;:

The nav element will take up the full width of the viewport.
padding: 100px 7% 0;:

This sets padding around the nav element. The padding on the top is 100px, the left and right padding are 7% of the width of the parent element, and there is no padding on the bottom.
This likely creates a large space at the top of the page before the navigation bar itself, possibly due to a desire to offset the content or to accommodate other design elements.
background: #000;:

Sets the background color of the nav to black (#000).
text-align: right;:

Aligns the text (or content inside the nav) to the right side of the container.
max-height: 100px;:

This limits the maximum height of the nav element to 100px. If the content inside the nav exceeds this height, it will be clipped (hidden), and no scrolling will occur.
overflow: hidden;:

This hides any content that overflows beyond the nav's max-height. Since max-height is set to 100px, if the content inside the nav exceeds this height, it won't be visible.
transition: max-height 0.5s;:

This adds a smooth transition effect when the max-height changes. The transition will take 0.5 seconds to complete, so any changes in height (such as expanding or collapsing the nav) will be animated.

    var navBar = document.getElementById("navBar");:

This line grabs the HTML element with the ID navBar and stores it in the navBar variable. In your case, this element is likely a <nav> element that holds the navigation bar.
This allows you to manipulate the nav element later in the script.
function togglebtn() {...}:

This is a JavaScript function named togglebtn. It will be triggered when a certain event occurs, like clicking a button (in your case, likely the hamburger icon).
The purpose of this function is to toggle a class on the navBar element.
navBar.classList.toggle("hidemenu");:

The classList.toggle() method checks if the specified class ("hidemenu") is currently applied to the element.
If the class is not applied, it adds the class.
If the class is already applied, it removes the class.
In your case, the "hidemenu" class is used to change the state of the nav element (likely toggling the visibility or expanding/collapsing the menu).
